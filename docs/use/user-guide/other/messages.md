# ðŸ–¨ Notifications

The message notification feature of the self-custody platform helps users stay updated on changes and the latest developments in their accounts in a timely manner. When there are unread messages, a small red dot will be displayed. Upon clicking and entering the messages, the red dot will disappear.

There are five types of message notifications:

1. Organization Invitation Messages
2. New Device Login Requests
3. Role and Permission Adjustments
4. Login IP Changes
5. Department Minimum Approval Count Adjustments

For instance, when a member of an organization applies to log in with a new device, the superior of their department will receive a notification in the message center. By clicking on the notification, they can proceed to approve the member's new device login.
