# üîè Disaster Recovery

SINOHOPE has established a multi-level private key shard backup system to address potential disaster recovery scenarios:

1. **Device Replacement Scenario:** At the organizational level, organization creators (Owners) and administrators (Admins) have a mutual backup relationship, and user accounts are bound to devices. If the organization creator needs to replace their device, they should contact the platform for identity verification and account recovery on the new device. For Admins needing to replace their device, the Owner will need to verify the change. The Owner can review the Admin's device replacement request in the message center, and upon approval, the Admin can proceed with the device change. Similarly, co-admins and members of other types in the department require validation from their superiors before proceeding. It's important to note that involving multiple roles and departments in a device change requires approval from the organization creator or admin.
2. **Platform Unavailability Scenario:** Sinhope employs robust security encryption and trusted execution environments to secure co-admin private key shards. If necessary, users can use offline tools to retrieve the two private key shards hosted on SINOHOPE and recover the complete private key.
3. **Extreme Scenarios:** The platform offers users a financial-grade online, distributed, multi-active private key storage system. It employs three-tier device isolation, offline cold storage backups, and integrates professional third-party institution backup and recovery services to ensure that user private keys can be recovered even in extreme situations.
