**Explanation of Available Assets**

A user's available assets consist of several types:

1. **Balance:** The user's balance on the blockchain.
2. **In Transit:** Assets that are in the process of being approved and haven't yet been confirmed on the blockchain.
3. **Frozen:** This applies mainly to UTXO-based blockchains like BTC. It refers to assets temporarily held for a transaction, which are released after the completion of the previous transaction.
