**Transfers**

Users can initiate transfers by swiping left on a token or clicking on token details to access the transfer page. Provided they have the necessary permissions or have completed the approval process, users need to input the recipient's address, transfer amount, remarks, Gas fee settings, and other details. After confirming, the transfer operation is completed.

**Gas Fee**

For blockchains like Ethereum that require gas fees, users need to pay gas fees to perform operations like transfers. The wallet will automatically estimate the gas fee based on the current network conditions and prompt users for the required payment. Different blockchains may have varying gas fee models. For example, Ethereum offers quick, standard, and custom gas fee options. Users can select the appropriate gas fee based on their preference and urgency.
