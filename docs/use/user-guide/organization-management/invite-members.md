# ðŸ“Ž Inviting Members

Within the self-custody platform, an organization can have multiple members, including different types. Members of different types possess varying permissions and responsibilities. The steps to join an organization are as follows:

1.The Owner logs in and accesses the organization management page, then clicks the "Invite" button.
