# ðŸ“ª Member Role

SINOHOPE provides users with various user roles, each having different levels of permissions:

1. **Owner :** The person who creates the organization, can add Admins, and possesses all permissions.
2. **Admin :** Has all permissions within the organization, can add, delete, and modify permissions for Co-admins and Colleagues.
3. **Co-admin:** Holds higher-level permissions, can create wallets, invite, delete, and set member information. They have permissions to initiate approvals, approve actions, add Tokens, etc. However, they cannot create departments, organizations, backup private key shards, or set the minimum approval threshold.
4. **Colleague :** Possesses lower-level permissions, can initiate approvals, view, add Tokens, and add addresses to the whitelist.
5. Users can invite other users to join the organization, and the invited person's level must be lower than that of the inviter. The invitation process follows the steps outlined in the "Inviting Members."

It's important to note that at the organizational level, Owners and Admins have a backup relationship, sharing the same permissions within the organization. If an Owner needs to change devices, they should contact the platform for identity verification before restoring the account on the new device. In case an Admin needs to change devices, verification will be conducted by the Owner.
